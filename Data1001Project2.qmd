# Client Bio

![](https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image0010OYE.jpg){fig-alt="Shri Bhupender Yadav" fig-align="left" width="250"}

**Client**: Shri Bhupender Yadav, Hon’ble Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India (https://moef.gov.in/cabinet-minister)

**Bio**: He leads India's government’s ministry that oversees climate change strategy, biodiversity conservation, and pollution control. His ministry is responsible for guiding India's progress towards sustainable development.

# Recommendation

India should learn a **cautionary** lesson from China: rapid CO2 intensity reduction with economic growth is possible (*Evidence-1.1 & 1.2*) but comes at the cost of CO2 emissions climbing (*Evidence-2*).

India, unlike China, should prioritize economic growth through **green energy** and **digital products** (like AI and robotics) that make better use of resources.

In the scatter plot showing CO2 intensities of various countries, India and China stand out as the ideal countries to compare. Both of these countries have similar GDPs. However, China has significantly reduced its CO2 intensity while increasing its GDP. Meanwhile, India has increased its GDP, but was not successful in reducing its CO2 intensity as drastically as China. This is made clearer by the trend lines shown below.

While India maintained a lower absolute carbon intensity (CO2 per GDP) than China throughout 1999-2023 (ending at 0.27 kg/\$ vs 0.421 kg/\$ ), China achieved a much faster rate of intensity reduction (-34% vs. India's -23.7%). Chart 1 and Chart 2 clearly show China's steeper downward decline, particularly after 2011, while India's decline was more gradual. This initially suggests China found effective ways to make its GDP grow while emitting less CO2. The work by Wang et al. (2018) supports this finding. Their findings indicate periods where a decline in China’s CO2 intensity was seen as the economy expanded (Fu et al., 2024).

However, examining China's specific trends reveals a hidden point. During the same period its carbon intensity was falling, China's CO2 per capita emissions tripled (from \~2.7 tonnes in 1999 to \~8.4 tonnes in 2023). This means China's reduction in CO2/GDP was achieved by growing its GDP (the denominator) much faster than its CO2 emissions (the numerator), not by reducing overall emissions. Absolute CO2 emissions surged, contributing to the global mean surface temperature change from CO2 (which also rose sharply from 0.051°C to 0.142°C in the chart). This aligns with Global Carbon Budget 2023 (Friedlingstein, 2023), which mentions China's rapid industrialization heavily reliant on coal, and identifies China as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

## Limitations

-   Only CO2 data is used in this report. While CO2 is the dominant GHG, this excludes other GHGs (like methane, nitrous oxide).

-   Only data till 2023 is present. More recent conclusions cannot be derived.
